### Tokens
1. Create a token with a fixed fee
2. See a list of your own tokens
3. See list market of tokens (exclude own tokens)
4. Token should have a unique name and src (image)
5. Tokens can be bought

## Known issues
1. User balance and tokens list not updating after operation without page reload
2. Some components should be created like Tabs

5. Toasts that tx was successful

I'm staying that issues with respect to deadlines (it's 22 hr apprx)
Rell looks really laconic and powerful but without excess. I get 4-6 hours for docs and videos.
Everything is clear enough and predictable.
About env - I install Eclipse with Rell extension without any complexities.
I tried to run local Node but did not find instructions about .xml config and decided to not sit with the local set-up long time and use the web version that was started without any settings

P.S. When I leave Web IDE for night - Chrome tab going down in a morning
